description: "A Tramp Abroad is a work of travel literature, including a mixture of\
  \ autobiography and fictional events, by American author Mark Twain, published in\
  \ 1880. The book details a journey by the author, with his friend Harris (a character\
  \ created for the book, and based on his closest friend, Joseph Twichell), through\
  \ central and southern Europe. While the stated goal of the journey is to walk most\
  \ of the way, the men find themselves using other forms of transport as they traverse\
  \ the continent. The book is the third of Mark Twain's five travel books and is\
  \ often thought to be an unofficial sequel to the first one, The Innocents Abroad.\n\
  As the two men make their way through Germany, the Alps, and Italy, they encounter\
  \ situations made all the more humorous by their reactions to them. The narrator\
  \ (Twain) plays the part of the American tourist of the time, believing that he\
  \ understands all that he sees, but in reality understanding none of it.\n\n\n From\
  \ Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
